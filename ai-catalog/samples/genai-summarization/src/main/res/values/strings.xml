    <string name="summarization_sample_text_1">Standing proudly at the foot of Market Street along the Embarcadero, the San Francisco Ferry Building is one of the most iconic landmarks of the city. Opened in 1898, this grand Beaux-Arts structure, designed by architect A. Page Brown, immediately became a symbol of the city, distinguished by its elegant arcades and soaring 245-foot clock tower, modeled after the 12th-century Giralda bell tower in Seville, Spain. For decades, the Ferry Building served as the primary gateway to San Francisco. Before the Golden Gate and Bay Bridges spanned the water, nearly everyone arrived and departed the city via ferry. At its peak in the 1930s, it was one of the busiest transit terminals in the world, bustling with up to 50,000 commuters daily. Remarkably, its robust steel frame allowed it to survive the devastating 1906 earthquake and fire with relatively little structural damage. With the opening of the bridges in the late 1930s and the rise of automobile travel, ferry traffic drastically declined. The building was converted largely into office space in the 1950s, the grand 660-foot-long skylit nave of the building obscured. The construction of the elevated Embarcadero Freeway further isolated it from the city. However, after the freeway was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and subsequently removed, a new vision emerged. A meticulous, four-year, $110 million restoration culminated in the triumphant reopening of the building in 2003 as the Ferry Building Marketplace. The ground floor was transformed into a vibrant public market celebrating the artisan food producers of Northern California. Today, it houses acclaimed restaurants, cafes, and specialty food shops offering everything from artisan cheese and bread to oysters and chocolate. It remains an active ferry terminal, hosts a beloved farmers market multiple days a week, and contains desirable office space, successfully blending its historic past with a dynamic present as a culinary destination and community hub.</string>
    <string name="summarization_sample_text_2">Bubble tea, known also as boba tea, is a delightful drink that began its journey in Taiwan during the 1980s. It quickly grew from a local favorite to a global phenomenon, cherished for its unique combination of flavors and textures. At its core, bubble tea features a base of brewed tea. Popular choices include robust black tea, fragrant green tea, and nuanced oolong tea. This tea base is then typically blended with milk or a variety of fruit flavors, ranging from classic mango and passion fruit to more adventurous taro and matcha. Sweeteners are adjusted to personal preference, allowing for a wide spectrum of taste experiences. What truly sets bubble tea apart are the additions, most famously the chewy tapioca pearls. These small, dark spheres made from cassava starch provide a pleasant, resilient bite enjoyed through an oversized straw. Beyond tapioca, drinkers can choose from a diverse selection of toppings like grass jelly, aloe vera, and popping boba that burst with fruit juice. Bubble tea is more than just a drink; it represents a cultural trend and a social experience for many, particularly younger generations. Boba shops have become popular gathering spots, offering a casual and fun environment. Served cold, often shaken to create a frothy top layer which some believe is the origin of the name "bubble tea," this versatile beverage continues to evolve, with new combinations and styles appearing regularly across the world. Its enduring appeal lies in its customizability and the surprising joy of sipping and chewing this sweet, flavorful treat.</string>
    <string name="summarization_sample_text_3">Large Language Models built using the Transformer architecture have revolutionized how we interact with artificial intelligence, particularly in text-based applications. Understanding how they work involves grasping a few core concepts. At their heart, Transformer LLMs process text not just word by word sequentially, but by considering all words in a piece of text simultaneously. This is made possible by a mechanism called self-attention. Self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of each word in relation to every other word in the input sequence, regardless of their position. This helps the model understand context and relationships between distant words, something earlier models struggled with. The original Transformer architecture had an encoder-decoder structure. The encoder processed the input text, building a rich representation, and the decoder used this representation to generate the output text. Many modern large LLMs, however, primarily use only the decoder part, trained to predict the next word in a sequence based on all the preceding words. When you provide text to a Transformer LLM, it first converts the words into numerical representations called embeddings. These embeddings capture some semantic meaning. The self-attention mechanism then processes these embeddings, allowing the model to refine its understanding of the input text context. Finally, the model generates output by predicting the most probable next word, based on the context it has processed. This predicted word is then added to the sequence, and the process repeats until a complete response is generated. This powerful attention mechanism and the ability to process text in parallel are key to the capabilities of todays leading LLMs. </string>
    <string name="summarization_sample_text_4">CRISPR-Cas9 is a revolutionary technology allowing scientists to precisely edit genes. Its mechanism, inspired by a natural defense system in bacteria, involves two key players: a protein called Cas9 and a guide RNA molecule. Think of Cas9 as molecular scissors capable of cutting DNA. The guide RNA acts like a navigation system for Cas9. Scientists design this small RNA molecule to have a sequence that matches the specific DNA they want to target and potentially alter. The guide RNA binds to the Cas9 protein, forming a complex that then searches the vast expanse of a cells DNA. When the guide RNA finds its complementary sequence in the DNA, it directs Cas9 to that exact location. Cas9 then makes a precise cut across both strands of the DNA double helix. This cut is the crucial step; it signals the cell to repair the DNA break. The cells natural repair machinery can fix this break in different ways. One way is to simply join the broken ends back together, which can sometimes lead to small errors that inactivate the gene. Alternatively, if scientists provide a corrected DNA sequence as a template, the cell can use it during the repair process, effectively inserting or correcting the genetic code at the cut site. This ability to make targeted changes to DNA holds immense promise for treating genetic diseases and advancing biological research.</string>"
    <string name="summarization_sample_text_5">Preparing for a marathon is a significant undertaking requiring dedication and consistent effort. It involves much more than simply running long distances; a well-rounded approach is crucial for success and injury prevention. A structured training plan forms the backbone of marathon preparation. This plan should gradually increase your weekly mileage, allowing your body to adapt to the growing demands. Consistency is paramount; sticking to your running schedule, which will include a mix of easy runs, tempo runs, and crucial long runs, builds the necessary endurance. Equally important is incorporating rest and recovery into your routine. Rest days allow muscles to repair and grow stronger, reducing the risk of overuse injuries that can derail training. Proper sleep is a vital part of this recovery process. Fueling your body correctly is another key element. A balanced diet providing sufficient carbohydrates for energy, along with adequate hydration, supports your training efforts and prepares you for race day demands. Experimenting with nutrition during long training runs helps determine what works best for your system. Finally, mental preparation plays a significant role. Building mental toughness and visualizing race day success can help you push through challenging moments during both training and the marathon itself. Approaching the process with patience and a positive mindset will enhance your overall experience.</string>"
